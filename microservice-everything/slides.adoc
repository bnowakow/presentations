* Who am I?
* YDP - Education Publisher
* Most of examples are from YDP experience
** But not all
* I wasn't actually implementing many of those, unfortunately
* I don't claim this ideas perfect. It was good enough in context
** I'm happy to discuss it and ritualy dissent them
** I'm not my ideas

Micro Service is an *architectural concept* that aims to decouple a solution by decomposing functionality into discrete services +

[NOTE]

====
* We are talking about scattered services, loosely coupled with HTTP calls
====

[.topic]
== My personal definition

[.incremental]
* A small problem domain [detail]#Bounded Content might be the thing#
* Built and deployed by itself [detail]#standalone and isolated#
* Runs in its own process
* Integrates via well-known interfaces + 
[detail]#While HTTP isn’t always the best answer, it’s a damn fine first guess#
* Owns its own data storage [detail]#ultimate goal#

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Obviously much depend on context
** Own data might not always be the case (with legacy systems)
* Lot has been said about decoupled services during this conference
** Reactive, vert.x, dropwizard, etc
** I think tthat gives you a certain feeling what's the buzz

* Pointed out by Martin Odersky at GOTOchicago
* Single Responsibility Principle  taken to an extreme

[.statement]
*SOA* done right?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Is it kind of SOA done right?
* 15 years since the concept of Service Oriented Architecture
* significant changes in the way we think about architecture
** ESB is not always SOA - when the sevices are deeply coupled in a non visible way
====

== !
[.statement]
*Aggregates* and bounded *Contexts* give us a great way of breaking up a domain

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Eric Evan’s - Domain Driven Design
* things evangelised by Slawek Sobotka, Piotr Wyczesany - at least during last two days in here
* Service interface between each context
* ensure a service is responsible for an aggregate root and all of it’s child domain objects
====

[.statement]
*REST* style interfaces and *JSON* as a data interchange

Build *web services* +  
[.pull-right]#easier than ever# 
with *micro frameworks*

** Simple embedded Jetty,

[.topic]
== Some problems with monolythic architecture

[.middle.incremental]
* Even when layered, hidden coupling
* Single runtime, allows in memory calls
* FUD: if it works don't fix it [detail]#don't touch it# 
* Good diagrams not always make it to good code

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* I know this might not always be true
** Though it usually happens
====


[.topic]
== The beshitted legacy system 

[.middle.incremental]
* don't touch it approach [detail]#as if you meant it#
* write a small service that does what's needed +
[detail]#instead of diving into legacy system#
* an architecture evolution

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Working with legacy code is risky at best
* We all know it

* That was the initial approach- which I didn't like
* I personally dislike JSF
* After further discussion with business - the need was for mobile UI
** Primefaces didn't make much sense in such case (remember 2009)
* The app took ages to deploy so the development was hell
** 25 minuts with full caching
** I'm blaming the workstations - but still had to find another way

* Imagine situation like this
* Some UI components working together with ActiveX things
* Installed on the browser side
* ActiveX was a C-plus-plus wrapper around C-plus-plus library for sound processing
* Worked fine on Windows / until IE8 - and than stopped
* Few applications were quite heavily dependent on (on the ActiveX API)

== What if's?

[.incremental]
* the same library would work as a service
* it was a REST web service
* there was no C++ web server
* there was no way anyone would write C++
* we used more developer friendly language

* Externalized sound component
* Wrapped in Python win32com (as that was purely windows library)
** We were considering node.js native bindings, but went for python
* Wrap the C++ library and expose with REST webservice
** Tornado was the choice
** It's nonblocking I/O was somehow similar to node's idea
* Surprise surprise - it worked

====
* it's hard to say. architecture decisions does not pay off quickly (usually)
* in some causes that was the only way to go
** The approach (you may argue it was just SOA) help us solve certain problems
* We haven't really touched on operations, deploying small thingies
** In many cases it's a component cased architecture
