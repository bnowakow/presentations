Not *only* clean code

* Bartosz, Arquillian Persistence Extension. The true opensource warrior.
* I'd like to tell you a story how I went the path Bartosz described
** How I went beyond my daily job
* Reverse engineering the clean code
** Not in a way you turn a _class_ file into _java_ file
** In a way Mitnick reversed security through it's social aspects

* Back in 2008 I was laying down code, best I could - like most people did.
* There better and worse examples. I did was constatly improving. 
** At least that's what I tought when I looked back my old code

* one day I realized there can and must be a beaty in code
** prolly when I first time compared Calendar API and JodaTime
** or looked up Guava (called Google Collections at that time)

* Now when I think about it, it was definatelly master - apprentice relation
* The rules. *The dogmna*. Variables. Names. Comments
* I realized my craft was improving
** I felt like I had this rules tatoos at my arm
* But yet another realization came
** Do I do this to keep the code maintanable, easier to change
** I kept focus beter
* My team mates are more eager to change my code
* I realized clean code wasn't on it's own. It was a result. *Not the cause*

* That way I got to Kent Beck
* The clean code was the effect. The cause was somewhere else
** I know Uncle Bob was ranting about implementation patterns in clean code book. *I don't care*
* Kent has given this different perspective on what was important
** what the implementation was really about
* Communication. Simplicity. Flexibility - as the values.
** Kind of a-ha moment

* Now I know where it's comming all from
* You can feel like a boss. Sometimes being a bit superior and dicky
* That might be how you feel when you get all that
** Or you can dig harder and deeper
** Look for some other inspirations. Go beyond beauty in code, cause it's not about beauty

* Each of these make you feel different emotions
** Though all wakes a sense of beauty in you. Because all of those where neatly designed.
* It's all about what we feel,what happends within our mind when we see such objectes
* Same can happen when working with beautiful code
** I'll get there

* We see a box and we build a mental model around that, in our mind.

[.small.quote]
____
a *quality* of an *object*, which *allows* an individual *to perform an action*. For example, a knob affords twisting, and perhaps pushing, while a cord affords pulling

* Not only among phisical objects, also in IT
** See Android. It's after all fairly easy to bash about
* See this box. It has slider, which suggests an action. 
** But at the same time it's a button. WTF??

* Yeah. That was funny, but how it works with code?
** Has it's nature this sugegsts us certain actions we can or should perform.

Now take this example

* mental model: what model you build when you see this code
* affordance: what actions does this code allow you to do
* signifiers: or more, what it suggests
