[.statement]
The is no such thing as legacy +
If not used - abandon +
If you can't - business as usual +
[pull-right]#*cope with it!*#

[.topic.recap.red-border]
== Rule #2

[.statement]
When not *manual* +
 consider it *safe*

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* automatic refactoring, replacing class with another
* wrapping or decorating legacy class with a new one
* to be replaced
* we keep the interface, delegate, start testing
====

[.topic]
== The test looks badly

[source, java]
----
WebServiceWrapper client = new WebServiceWrapper();

System.out.println("SERVICE:getUserEmployment#####################");
String[][] result = client.getUserEmployment(key, userid, dt1, dt2);

for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < result[i].length; j++) {
    System.out.print("USER_EMPLOYMENT: [" + i + "][" + j + "]: ");
    System.out.println(result[i][j]);
  }
}
System.out.println();

====
* That's officially worst code snipper ever shown on this conference
* But at least it shows someting
* It's like a characteristics of our class / method

== \\

[.small.quote, Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code]
____
A characterization test is a mean to describe (characterize) the actual behavior of an existing piece of software.
____

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* if we run such test again and again, repeativly, through many different data sets
* It'll at least tell us if we are doing something wrong
====

[.topic]
== Simplistic use case

[source, java]
.+BusinessCode.java+
----
public class BusinessClass {

  public String businessMethod(String param) {
    return param.split(" ")[0];
  }

}
----

== And the test case

[source, java]
.+BusinessCodeTest.java+
----
public class BusinessClassTest {

  @ClassRule
  public static CharacterizationRule rule =
        aRuleFor(BusinessClassTest.class)
        .build();

  private BusinessClass service = new BusinessClass();

  @Test
  public void just_run_the_method() {
    final String param = "first parameter"
    System.out.println("param = " + param);
    String output = service.businessMethod(param);
    System.out.println("after split = " + output);
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* No Runners, @RunWith is so 2000
* ClassRule / just Rule - doesn't matter
* I suggest to keep it single responsible and run a single logger for all methods

* The whole idea is to have a single test code and change the behaviour
====

[.topic]
== Two modes: logging and verify

[source, java]
----
final public static String ENV_NAME_FOR_RECORDING = "pinchpoint";

private boolean isRecording() {
  String env = System.getProperty(ENV_NAME_FOR_RECORDING);
  return (env != null);
}
----

[source, shell]
.+runit.sh+
----
mvn test -Dpinchpoint=true -Dtest=BusinessCodeTest
----

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* We run exactly the same code
** one time logging
** the other verifing if everything worked fine
* After initial logging we can start chenging class
** Looking if the output hasn't changed - it shouldn't
====

[.topic]
== External Resource

[.small.quote]
____
A base class for Rules that set up an external resource before a test and tear it down afterward.
____

== Logging mode

[source, java]
----
public class FileOutputCapture extends ExternalResource {

  protected void before() throws Throwable {
    original = System.out;
    PrintStream pos = new PrintStream(capturedStream);
    System.setOut(pos);
  }

  protected void after() {
    System.setOut(original);
    try {
      Files.write(outputFile.toPath(),
              capturedStream.toByteArray(),
              StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("File write failed! ", e);
    }
  }
}

[.topic]
== Do my maven thing again

[source, shell]
.+runit.sh+
----
mvn test -Dtest=BusinessCodeTest
----


[.topic]
== Verification phase: capture again

[source, java]
.+Capture+
----
public class StreamOutputCapture extends ExternalResource {
  PrintStream original;

  protected void before() throws Throwable {
    original = System.out;
    PrintStream pos = new PrintStream(capturedStream);
    System.setOut(pos);
  }

  protected void after() {
    System.setOut(original);
  }
}
----

[.topic]
== Verifier

[.small.quote]
____
Verifier is a base class for Rules like ErrorCollector, which turns passing test methods into failing tests if a verification check is failed
____


[.topic]
== and verify

[source, java]
.+Verify+
----
public class CaptureVerifier extends Verifier {

  protected void verify() throws Throwable {
    List<String> actual = ReadLines.fromStream(capturedStream);
    List<String> original = ReadLines.fromFile(pinchFile);

    Patch<String> patch = DiffUtils.diff(original, actual);

    assertThat(patch, is(empty()));
  }
}

----

[.topic]
== Results?

[source, txt]
----
java.lang.AssertionError:
File:
  </tmp/com.example.BusinessClassTest.txt>

line: <3>, expected:<something> but was:<something else>
